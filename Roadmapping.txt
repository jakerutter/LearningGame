Thoughts on LearningGame

	Features [not currently odered by priority]
		
		
		-Attach application to DB so that I can read and write to external file for better stat tracking.
			One option is firebase DB.
			
		-Add sounds. Background music. One sound for a wrong answer, another for a correct answer, and another for an achievement or milestone reached.
			Requires research into how to hook sounds into my application.
			
		-Improve overall appearance.
			More pleasing colors. A range of colors. Or colors that change based on streak length.
			
		-Add experience & levels. Using FireBase Db record the user experience earned and the total number of correct questions. Create levels,
			achievements, and % of correct answers overall.
			
		-Update the application to use bootstrap for responsiveness on all device types.
		
		-Incorporate styling [background color, font color/style, div borders and shape] based on either the current player streak or the % of correct
			answers provided for any given session. Would do this by adding javascript that takes the div's value and displays a specific styling class
			according to that value. The styling class should include all of the desired css changes within it.
		
		-Add a beaker or bar-chart type of image. This image will be a goal tracker as set by the player. At onset of session the player will set their
			goal and the beaker will track the progress of that goal. Example: 50 correct questions.

		-Add fontAwesome icons for improved styling, interaction, and visual stimulation.
			A thumbs up when correct, a thumbs down when wrong.
			
	Completed Functionality Added:
	
		-Add a check that ensures the current question gets answered before another one is generated.
			In order to do this I can add a boolean to problemObj that is called isAnswered that is set to true when answered. Will check this before
			firing the functions that generate and display a new problem.
			*Currently this does not prevent the first question from being skipped. All subsequent questions are protected.
			
		-Add html that allows for space on either side of the gameplay to display stats, level, experience and other things.
			This will require adding another div outside of game wrapper with the class 'lane' that will provide adequate space for 3 vertical areas.
		
		-Add a user-control that allows the changing of types of math problems provided. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
		
		-Add a html area that displays the highest streak ever reached.
		
		-Add a user-control that allows the raising and lowering of the size of numbers used when generating math problems.
			This would require reworking the current hard coded answer-options that exist. Because +-4 of a large number is probably not sufficient
			for answer variance when larger numbers are considered.
			*Have not yet changed the way that incorrect answer-options are generated.
