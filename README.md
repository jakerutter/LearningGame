# Learning Game

This is a small project I began when my daughter was in kintergarden. I wanted to practice my skills outside of work and make her an interactive Math Game. Make Math Fun!, ya know?

# Note

This program is the first version. The more updated version can be found in the Math Game repository. Please check there for the latest features and improvements.

### What can you Learn?

This program currently has multiple types of math problems. Included are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, simple algebraic equations, times tables and word problems.


### Test It Out

This is currently hosted here on Github if you would like to give it a try. Suggestions welcome.
