# LearningGame
# An interactive learning game built with html, css, and javascript.

# The concept is to have a game where a child can solve simple math problems in a
# manner that is fun. I want to have a counter for number of consecutive correct answers
# as well as css styling and perhaps sound for correct and incorrect responses.

# Further down the road I may make it so that when the user gets 'x' number correct in
# a row the questions get harder or introduce something new (like negatives).

# This game is a project I am making for my daughter as she is entering first grade.
